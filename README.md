# AI-DRIVEN DRUG AUTHENTICATION, VERIFICATION AND PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM

## AI-Powered Barcode Scanning and Drug Authentication
• Mobile Application Development: Develop a mobile app that allows users to scan the barcode or QR code on drug packaging. The app should connect to a central, government-managed database containing records of all registered pharmaceuticals in Tanzania.

• Real-Time AI Verification: When a user scans a barcode, the app verifies the drug’s authenticity by cross-referencing it with the central database. If the drug is legitimate, the app should display detailed information including:

 ◦ Drug Name

 ◦ Manufacturer

◦ Ingredients

◦ Safety Warnings

◦ Usage Instructions

◦ Expiration Date

◦ Dosage Information

If the barcode does not match or if there are discrepancies (e.g., incorrect manufacturer information), the app should flag the drug as potentially counterfeit.

• Counterfeit Drug Alerts: If the drug is flagged as counterfeit, the app should display:

◦ A clear message stating that the drug is fake.

◦ Information on the potential risks associated with using counterfeit drugs, including health hazards, side effects, and possible legal consequences.

◦ Guidance on what steps to take next, such as how to report the counterfeit drug to authorities and where to seek genuine medication.
User Feedback Loop

• Allow users to provide feedback about the drug and report any issues they encounter. This feedback can be used to enhance the AI’s detection capabilities and improve the app's accuracy over time.

## Interactive Chatbot Integration

• AI-Powered Chatbot: Integrate an AI chatbot that engages users when a drug is flagged. The chatbot should:

 ◦ Explain potential issues with the flagged drug.

 ◦ Provide safety advice and information on the risks of counterfeit drugs.

 ◦ Guide users on reporting the drug to the relevant authorities.

 ◦ Offer educational content on drug safety and how to identify counterfeit drugs.

• Public Education: The chatbot should also serve as an educational tool, offering information on drug safety practices, how to identify fake drugs, and the importance of drug verification. Users can interact with the chatbot at any time for information and support.
